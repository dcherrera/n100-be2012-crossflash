# One-shot: swap from BE82CB modem -> BE2013 (Global) modem.
# Fully reversible: BE82CB image stays on disk; run swap-to-be82cb-modem.sh
# to revert in ~1 min.
#
# Goal: determine empirically whether BE2013 modem now works with our
# patched ofono (it returned iccIOForApp INTERNAL_ERR before any ofono
# patches were in place — maybe that was downstream of the PIN-auth
# blocker, maybe it's a real modem-firmware issue).
