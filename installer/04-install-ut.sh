#
# The recovery flashed in step 3 (rubencarneiro/billie2 1.0 from Oct 2023)
# ships with gpg 1.4.13 from 2012, which cannot verify the SHA512 signatures
# UBports has been using on system-image files since at least early 2025.
# Every install attempt with the stock recovery fails at the signature step.
#
# Workaround: use magiskboot on-device to repack the recovery image with
# patched `/sbin/system-image-upgrader` (verify_signature() => return 0) and
# stubbed `/system/bin/gpg`. Then push the UT system-image files and reboot
# to recovery — the auto-process script picks them up and applies the install
# with signature checks bypassed.
#
# This works end-to-end on macOS without ever leaving the host.
#
# Prereqs:
#   - 03-bootstrap-recovery.sh complete
#   - Phone is currently in bootloader-fastboot (last action of step 3)
