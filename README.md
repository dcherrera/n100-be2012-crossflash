# n100-be2012-crossflash

> A [TeamIDE](https://teamide.dev) project. If this saved you a phone, [chip in](https://teamide.dev/support).

Reproducible installer that takes a **carrier-locked OnePlus Nord N100
BE2012 (T-Mobile US)** and lands it on **Ubuntu Touch 24.04 (noble)**.

**Built and tested on macOS** (Apple Silicon, macOS 26.2). Linux should
also work — the underlying tooling (`bkerler/edl`, `oppo_decrypt`,
`fastboot`, `magiskboot`) is cross-platform, and the wrapper scripts
auto-detect OS where it matters. Linux hasn't been independently
verified end-to-end yet; success reports welcome.

**No Windows.** No MSMDownloadTool, no borrowed PC, no VM.

If you have a BE2013 (Global) or BE83BA (EU) N100, **use the stock
[UBports installer](https://devices.ubuntu-touch.io/installer/)
instead.** This repo exists for the BE2012 SKU specifically, which the
stock installer rejects as "device not supported."

## Why this is a separate installer

The BE2012 trips four locks the stock UBports installer doesn't handle:

1. **`ro.product.name` is `OnePlusN100TMO`** — the stock installer
   only recognises `OnePlusN100`, so it refuses to start.
2. **`fastboot flashing unlock` is gated** by T-Mobile carrier shim
   apps holding `sys.oem_unlock_allowed=0`.
3. **The recovery's gpg 1.4.13 (2012) can't verify modern SHA512 sigs
   on UT system images** — every install attempt with stock recovery
   fails at the keyring step.
4. **Modem firmware ↔ ofono SIM-init incompatibility** — even after
   the steps above, ofono `sim_pin_query_cb` early-returns on a PIN
   auth error from the modem, leaving `Modem.Features` stuck at
   `['sim']`: no IMSI, no `NetworkRegistration`, no cellular.

This installer walks past all four:

| Step | What | How |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Cross-flash to BE2013 Global | macOS-native EDL/Firehose driver (`flash_xml.py`) using `bkerler/edl` + OnePlus's signed Firehose loader. Skips the patched-MSM project-ID hack because we never implement the host-side guard. |
| 2 | Bootloader unlock | Remove five OnePlus carrier-shim apps via `pm uninstall --user 0`. Flips `sys.oem_unlock_allowed` from 0 → 1; `fastboot flashing unlock` then works. |
| 2b | Modem re-flash | Put the BE82CB (T-Mobile US) `NON-HLOS.bin` back over the BE2013 modem. The BE2013 Global modem returns `iccIOForApp INTERNAL_ERR` against modern Halium-9 ofono until the patches in step 5 are in place — easier to just keep the T-Mobile-tuned modem from the start. Optional: skip this and use BE2013 modem (works fine with step 5 patches in place — see `installer/diagnostic/`). |
| 3 | Recovery + partition layout | Flash rubencarneiro UBports boot/recovery/dtbo, patched vbmeta (flags 0x3, verification off), resize `system_a` to 3 GB. |
| 4 | Install Ubuntu Touch | `magiskboot` (extracted from Magisk APK) repacks the recovery on-device with `system-image-upgrader` patched to skip GPG verification and `gpg` stubbed. Auto-install proceeds normally. |
| 5 | Cellular fix | Three-byte binary patch on `/usr/sbin/ofonod` (ofono-sailfish 1.29+git12). Hijacks the `sim_pin_query_cb` error path: instead of "log error and return," set `pin_type = OFONO_SIM_PASSWORD_NONE` and jump to the success continuation. SIM state machine advances, IMSI reads, `Features` → `['gprs','rat','ussd','net','cbs','stk','sms','sim']`. |

After step 5 the device runs Ubuntu Touch with a complete SIM stack.
Cellular *attach* additionally depends on SIM ↔ carrier ↔ band match
(see "Cellular caveats" in `installer/README.md`).

## Requirements

| Need | Why |
| --- | --- |
| **OnePlus Nord N100, model BE2012** | This installer is specific to this SKU. |
| **macOS** (Apple Silicon ok) | Tested on macOS 26.2; Intel Macs should work but untested. |
| **Python 3.10+**, `brew install libusb` | EDL Firehose client. |
| **USB-C data cable** (not charge-only) | EDL + fastboot. |
| **~13 GB free disk** | BE2013 firmware (~2.5 GB) + BE82CB firmware (~2.5 GB) + UT system-image (~600 MB) + scratch. |
| **Network** | Downloads firmware + UT system-image files. |
| **BE82CB.zip** (T-Mobile OnePlus N100 firmware, `bengal_14_O.04_201221`) | Needed by step 2b. The .zip is not redistributable — obtain it from a BE82CB device or a firmware archive. Place at `firmware/BE82CB.zip` or set `BE82CB_ZIP=<path>`. |

## Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dcherrera/n100-be2012-crossflash
cd n100-be2012-crossflash

# Step 0 — install deps, clone bkerler/edl + oppo_decrypt, fetch firmware
./installer/00-prep.sh

# Step 1 — cross-flash BE2012 → BE2013 (EDL mode, ~10 min)
./installer/01-cross-flash.sh

# Step 2 — unlock bootloader (after OOS first-boot + Google account)
./installer/02-unlock-bootloader.sh

# Step 2b — re-flash BE82CB modem (after post-unlock OOS first-boot)
./installer/02b-fix-modem.sh

# Step 3 — recovery + partition reshape
./installer/03-bootstrap-recovery.sh

# Step 4 — install Ubuntu Touch (~5 min)
./installer/04-install-ut.sh

# Step 5 — fix the SIM-init blocker (after UT first-boot + lock PIN set)
./installer/05-fix-cellular.sh
```

Each script is idempotent. See `installer/README.md` for per-step
detail (entering EDL, what to do during OOS first-boot, Wi-Fi reboot
fix, cellular caveats, etc.).

External tools (`tools/edl`, `tools/oppo_decrypt`), the Python venv
(`venv/`), the Android platform-tools (`host-tools/platform-tools/`),
and large firmware downloads (`firmware/`, `downloads/`) are all
fetched by `00-prep.sh` at runtime and gitignored.

## Reverse path — getting back to stock

Each step is reversible up to a point:

- **Before step 1:** unplug the cable. The phone is unchanged.
- **After step 1, before step 2:** flash BE82CB stock via the BE82CB
  unbrick tool (XDA: `opn100-oos-tmo-be82cb-unbrick-tool`).
- **After step 2 (bootloader unlocked):** same, plus you may need to
  re-lock the bootloader manually.
- **After step 4 (UT installed):** flash BE82CB unbrick tool. UT is
  wiped, you're back on T-Mobile OOS.

The original device-unique partitions (`modemst1`, `modemst2`, `fsg`,
`fsc`, `keystore`, `persist`, etc.) are backed up by step 1 to
`backup/be2012_pre_crossflash/` and can be re-flashed via
`flash_xml.py` if needed.

## Status of common features after this install

| Feature | Works? |
| --- | --- |
| Wi-Fi | Yes (long-press Power → Restart after first boot, then fine) |
| Bluetooth | Yes |
| Cellular SIM read (IMSI, ICCID, SubscriberNumbers) | Yes, with step 5 patches |
| Cellular network registration | Depends on SIM ↔ modem-band match. T-Mobile-network SIMs work; Verizon-provisioned SIMs read fine but won't sustain attach (IMEI not on Verizon's CDLC + modem firmware is T-Mobile-band tuned). |
| Mobile hotspot | Should work post-cellular (UT 24.04-1.1+ has the Halium-9 hotspot fix). Not yet empirically tested on this device — pending a working SIM. |
| Camera, audio, sensors | Yes (per upstream billie2 noble port) |
| VoLTE | Needs T-Mobile to whitelist the device IMEI. Plan on a support chat. |

### What rots first

The `05-fix-cellular.sh` ofonod offsets (`0x10b8f4`, `0xe1e94`,
`0xe1e98`) are valid only for the specific ofono build above. The
script asserts the file size and the bytes at each offset before
patching — if either differs, it refuses rather than corrupt the
binary. If you hit that, either:

1. Pin UT to the build above by editing `SYSIMG_CHANNEL` in
   `installer/lib/common.sh` (rough — locks you out of UT updates), or
2. Re-derive the offsets against the new ofonod binary. The patch
   sites are:
   - **EHPLMN (cosmetic):** `simfs_op_check_structure_cb` xref to the
     "Requested file structure differs from SIM: %x" string. The b.ne
     that takes the error path. Replace with `nop`.
   - **PIN-auth (functional):** `sim_pin_query_cb` xref to the
     "Querying PIN authentication state failed" string. Find the
     `adrp x0, <string>` + `add x0, x0, <off>` pair at the error path
     entry. Replace those two instructions with `mov w23, #0` and `b
     <success-continuation>`. The success continuation is the
     immediately-following success-path label that loads
     `[x21, #0x24]` (sim->pin_type). See inline comments in
     `installer/05-fix-cellular.sh` for the full rationale.

The cleaner long-term fix is to land the same logic upstream in
`ofono-binder-plugin` (treat the QMI/binder INTERNAL_ERR response on
QueryPinAuthState as `pin_type=NONE` rather than propagating the
error). PRs welcome.

## Status

Tested end-to-end on a single BE2012 unit (T-Mobile US, Apple Silicon
host, macOS 26.2). Reproductions, issue reports, and PRs welcome.
